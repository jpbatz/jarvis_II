# TITLE: statistics >> empty_statistics.py
# AUTHOR: Chalmer Lowe
# DESCRIPTION:

# The file: statistics.txt, has multiple numbers, separated by commas on each
#     line. NOTE: Not all lines will have the same number of values.
# In addition, each line has one of several statistical terms as the first
#     element: mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation
# For each line, identify the stats term, and perform that calculation on
#     the numbers on the list. All results should be rounded to a whole number
#     value (NOTE: do not simply truncate).
#     Sum the total of all results.
# For example:
#
#     mean,1,2,3,4,5           >                      3
#     median,1,3,5,7           >                      4
#     variance,2,1,1,0,0,1,3   > 1.1428571428571428 > 1
#     stdev,2,1,1,0,0,1,3      > 1.0690449676496976 > 1
#                              ---------------------------
#                                        total:       9
